## Installation

Clone or download the repository.

In the directory run:

`pip install .`

This will install all necessary packages and the waterstructureCreator using `setup.py`.

You need to redo the installation everytime you pull from git or you can install the package in the current directory by specifying the:

`pip install -e .`

Please keep in mind to use Python 3.8.3 for the installation and usage of the package and do not update the installed packages later on.

For testing the package, run the python-scripts in `/examples/` and check whether they generate plots or visualizations of the 2D water structures.
